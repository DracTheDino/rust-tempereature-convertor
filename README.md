# rust-tempereature-convertor

A small Rust program which converts tempereatures.

## How it works?

It will first prompt you to write down the tempereature unit you have to begin with. 
```
Choose 'f' or 'c' to start with.
```
After entering either `f` or `c`, standing for Fahrenheit and Celsius scales respectively, it will print the result in the opposite tempereature scale. Easy.

## Navigating source code

The `main.rs` file is present inside of `src` folder. That's all you need to know. I've not used any extra dependencies.
